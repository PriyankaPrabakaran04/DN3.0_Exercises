Understanding the Problem:
Why are data structures and algorithms essential in handling large inventories?

Efficiency: Efficient data structures and algorithms allow quick access, insertion, deletion, and updating of inventory items, which is crucial when dealing with large volumes of data.
Performance: Optimal algorithms reduce the time complexity of operations, ensuring that the system can handle high loads without significant performance degradation.
Scalability: Proper data structures help the system scale as the inventory grows, maintaining performance and usability.
Types of data structures suitable for this problem:

ArrayList: Good for maintaining a collection of items where order matters and random access is required.
HashMap: Ideal for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions based on keys (e.g., product IDs).
LinkedList: Useful for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions occur.
Given the need for quick access and updates based on product IDs, a HashMap is a suitable choice for our inventory management system.

Analysis
Time Complexity:

Add Product: The time complexity is 𝑂(1)
O(1) for the HashMap put operation.
Update Product: The time complexity is 𝑂(1)
O(1) for the HashMap put operation.
Delete Product: The time complexity is 𝑂(1)
O(1) for the HashMap remove operation.

Optimizations:

Ensure proper handling of collisions in the HashMap to maintain 
𝑂(1)
O(1) complexity.
Consider using concurrent data structures if the inventory system is to be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
For larger datasets, ensure efficient memory management to avoid excessive garbage collection overhead.
This setup provides a basic but efficient inventory management system using Java and a HashMap for fast access, updates, and deletions.
